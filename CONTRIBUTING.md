# Contributing to VPNHouse

Our goal is to build free, but powerful VPN solutions for personal usage. We appreciate each pull request, bug report, or feature request. Together we're able to evolve faster!

## Bug reports

If you want to report a bug please follow the next steps:

First of all, check the [issues](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/issues) page for the similar issue. 
Probably, it's already reported.

If not, just create a [bug report](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) 
and answer the questions, so we can understand and reproduce the issue.

Sometimes, we can't provide a fix or answer you immediately. Don't be upset because we are checking all reports and we will defenitly pay attention to you :smile:

# Minor improvements

Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/pulls) at any time, and if it is possible cover your pull requests with tests.

# New features

If you need a new feature please follow the next steps:

Check the [issues](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/issues) page to ensure that your suggestion is new.

After that, check open [pull requests](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/pulls) to be sure that no one is working on it.

If you are going to spend significant time implementing code for a pull request, it is better to open an 
issue and "claim" it to receive feedback before you spend your time.

**If someone has already opened a pull request and you think that it has stalled
just add a comment in it to make us pay attention on it.**

If it is possible, make a pull request as small as possible, or submit multiple pull requests to complete a feature. By "smaller" we mean that it is easier to understand, review, and merge it.
# Thank You
