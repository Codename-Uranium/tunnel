# Contributing to VPNHouse

Our goal is to build free, but powerful VPN solutions for personal usage. We appreciate any pull 
request, bug report or feature request. Together we're able to evolve faster!

## Bug reports

First, please, check [issues](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/issues) page for similar issue, 
probably it's already reported.

It not, please, create [bug report](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) 
and answer the questions so we can understand and reproduce issue.

Sometimes we can't give fix or answer immediately, please, be kind :smile:

#Minor improvements

Submit [pull request](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/pulls) at any time. Please, supply your 
updates with tests if possible.

# New features

First, please, check [issues](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/issues) page to ensure your 
suggestion is new.

Please, also check open [pull requests](https://github.com/vpnhouse/tunnel/pulls) to see is someone 
already working on this.


If you are going to spend significant time implementing code for a pull request, best to open an 
issue first and "claim" it and get feedback before you invest a lot of time.

**If someone already opened a pull request, but you think the pull request has stalled and you would
like to open another pull request for the same or similar feature, leave a commend in stalled pull 
request to resolve the situation and move things forward.**

If possible make a pull request as small as possible, or submit multiple pull request to complete a
feature. Smaller means: easier to understand and review. This in turn means things can be merged
faster.

# Thank You
